# Learning Journal
This site is the place where I will be documenting my learning on the **102 Code Fellows** week-long course.

# Growth Mindset
Growth Mindset is the ability to meet challeges with persistence.  In the face of difficult obstabcles it is the ability to keep trying despite not understanding something the first and even the sixth time.  Growth  mindset advocates excellence as a product of hard work rather than innate intelligence. In the gowth mindset model, learning is something for everyone.

*In summary*, growth mindset requires:
1. Persistence
2. Hard work
3. A positive attitude even in the face of challenges

As Confucius said: 
<It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you dont stop.
